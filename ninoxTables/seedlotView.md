# Seedlots View

Seedlot view is a table with a single record with no data, it serves solely as a form view.

It can be accessed through the blue ‘seedlots’ button on the [homepage](home.md).

It contains links back to the home page, and to the [batch view](batchView.md) table.

It also contains a view which (by default) contains all [seedlots](seedlots.md) on the system, by clicking on the headers at the top of the view - e.g. ‘date in’, these can be filtered down.
