# Ninox Tables

This section contains an overview of each of the different tables within Ninox. For each, there will be a summary of its purpose, along with a general idea of the way it works & interacts with other areas of the system (such as other tables, Integromat scenarios, and Python scripts.)

At the time of writing this documentation, the links are organised in the same order as the tables in Ninox, indentation has also been used to represent composition relationships.
