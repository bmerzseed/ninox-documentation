# Ninox Tables

This section contains an overview of each of the different tables within Ninox. For each, there will be a summary of its purpose, along with a general idea of the way it works & interacts with other areas of the system (such as other tables, Integromat scenarios, and Python scripts.)

At the time of writing this documentation, I tried to organise the links below in a similar order to the tables in Ninox, I also used indentation to indicate composition (i.e. parent/ child) relationships.
