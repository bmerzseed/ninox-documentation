Completed shipments is a single record view which can be accessed via the ‘completed shipments’ button under ‘reports’ on the [homepage](home.md), or via the ‘completed shipments’ option on the pop out menu
It shows a filterable view of all [shipments](shipmentsAndInvoices.md) that have been completed, and the time they were completed.
