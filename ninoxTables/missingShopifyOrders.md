# Missing Shopify Orders

This was a table created by Tom from Arctec to identify and import [sales orders](salesOrder.md) which failed to import from Shopify via the [Shopify orders to Ninox](../integromatScenarios/shopifyOrdersToNinox.md) Integromat scenario.

The table can (likely) now be deleted, as (as i understand) it only served as a single use way to identify and request them.
