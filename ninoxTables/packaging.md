# Packaging

The packaging table contains the different types of packaging used for bulk labels (i.e. sm glued, lg wh stapled etc). Each [saleable product](saleableProducts.md) which is a bulk label has one of these packaging records assigned to it.

On the [assembly dashboard](assemblyDash.md), users can see which type of packaging should be used for that particular product, they can also change it (this works via a dynamic choice box with on update triggers)

This table also has a ‘stock’ number field, though as of 17/05/2021 this stock field is not doing anything
