# Print Queue/ Seedlot list

This table serves as part of the print queue functionality.

Records are generated when the `print bulk labels` / `print small packets` buttons are pressed on the [packing dashboard](packingDash.md).

Records contain a type (i.e. bulk labels or small packets), and a list of [print queue items](printQueueItems.md) representing the batches printed by that run.

This table contains the print view used to print the seedlot list, this is generated and sent to the [a4 printing](../integromatScenarios/a4Printing.md) integromat scenario during the print buttons execution.

There is also a button to reprint the seedlot list on this record.
