# Email form

The ‘email form’ table has 2 purposes. Firstly to be used as an interface for users to send emails to customers, and secondly to serve as a record for all previous emails sent.

Users can create a record by pressing the ‘send email invoice’ button on a shipment or invoice record, this will popout the form with some profiled information (subject/ body/ type/ order), and will also attach the relevant invoice to the email. The user can then edit these fields should they want to, and also enter the customers email address.

Once they are ready. ‘send email’ will email the invoice from the ‘seedshop@seedcooperative.org.uk' email.

From the ‘orders’ tab, users can select ‘emails’ on show view to see any email form records that have been created for that order.

To edit default content of the emails, edit the ‘body’ field from an admin account, from here change the default. Doing this will cause all new emails to have the new default body.
