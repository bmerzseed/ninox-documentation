# Seedlots

Seedlots are a child of [component products](componentProds.md)

They also have many to one relationships with

- [growers](grower.md)
- [suppliers](supplier.md)
- [country codes](countryCodes.md)

These relationships do not serve a functional purpose as of now, and were intended to be expanded as part of purchase order functionality. For now, they are primarily a data store.

Next, a series of fields used to store information about the seedlot

- seedlot code
  - the unique identifier for the seedlot
  - currently, created manually
  - should these be duplicated somehow, they should be picked up by the [dupes checker](../systemTasks/pythonScripts/dupesChecker.md) python script
- date in

  - defaults to the current date when the seedlot is created
  - can be manually changed

- expiry date
  - manually set
- status
  - demeter or organic
  - depending on the value, the demeter logo will/ won't be shown on batches created from this seedlot
- harvest year
- weight (g) / 1000 seeds
  - required to assemble many small packets (unless `exempt from seedlot` is true on the component product)
  - if it has not already been entered, users will input this during the assembly process via the [seedlot count form](seedlotCountForm.md)
  - used to calculate more accurate expected usage when using this seedlot
- germination rate
- shelf
  - formula which defaults to the component products shelf number
  - if a value is entered into custom shelf number on this record, it will instead use that value
- start size
  - initial size of the seedlot
  - manually set
- remaining size
  - manually set initially
  - afterwards this value will be changed via adjustments either through the [packets dashboard](packetsDash.md) or through the [assembly dashboard](assemblyDash.md)
- barcode/ generate barcode
  - seedlot label printing is a more manual process than for batches), therefore we can use a barcode stored within Ninox
  - this barcode is generated by clicking the `generate barcode` button, this makes a post request to the [seedlot barcoding](../integromatScenarios/seedlotBarcoding.md) integromat scenario, which automatically populates the field with a barcode

Next, the `show view` choice box which is used to conditionally display relationship views depending on the choice selected

- batches
  - displays a list of batches created using this seedlot
- operating logging
  - shows relevant records from the [packets dashboard](packetsDash.md)
    - seedlot adjustments
    - batch creations
    - batch disassemblies
- orders used in
  - doesnt use a direct relationship
  - uses a `select` statement to get [sales orders](salesOrders.md) where batches which use this seedlot were used
