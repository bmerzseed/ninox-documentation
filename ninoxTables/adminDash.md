# Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard table is almost completely unused.

Prior to the addition of the `isAdminMode()` builtin function, it was created to act as a similar admin toggle functionality.

Due to an issue with `writable if's` and the `select` statement, this never quite worked as expected (and is now obselete anyway)

The table has also been used for random experiments/ testing on occasion.

It could be deleted with (almost certainly) no consequences
