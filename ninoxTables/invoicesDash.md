# Invoices Dashboard

Invoices dashboard is a single record view which can be accessed via the ‘invoices’ button under ‘reports’ on the [homepage](home.md). It shows a filterable view of all [invoice view](invoicesView.md) records, with information about their [shipment](shipmentsAndInvoices.md) completion time, and whether or not the invoice has been sent to xero.
