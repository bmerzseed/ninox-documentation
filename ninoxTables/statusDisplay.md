# Status Display

Status display is a table with 2 records, one with status ‘demeter’ and one with status ‘organic’.

The ‘demeter’ record has an empty image field, and the ‘organic’ record has an image of a white box in its image field.

These images are used in the printing of the small packets, with the white box of the organic image field covering the ‘demeter’ logo if the seedlot used to generate that batch is organic.
