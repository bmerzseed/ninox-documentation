# Overnight Routine to Create Xero Invoices from Ninox 11am and 9pm

This scenario was created by Tom from Arctec as part of the Xero integration.

The scenario itself is very simple, it runs at 11am and 9pm each day, and will create a record in the [overnightRoutines](../ninoxTables/overnightRoutines.md) table in Ninox, triggering the sending of invoices to Xero.
